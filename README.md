# Brainflix

Brainflix was a project that highly resembled Youtube's UI and basic functionality. The project was initially done over three one week sprints in order to understand the basics of React, State, React Router, React lifecycles, Node.js, and Express. The user is able to browse through pages of videos to watch through dynamic routing. The user is also able to upload videos, comment on videos, and delete comments from a video. Since first doing this project, I switched the project from using vanilla JavaScript to TypeScript using ES6 modules.
